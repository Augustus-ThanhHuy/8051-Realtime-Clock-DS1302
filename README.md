# **8051 Realtime clock Ds1307**
## Introduction
This is our team's project about the 8051 microcontroller
It has all the functions of an electronic watch including:
* Real-time display
* Press time
* Watch the time
* Alarm
* Display temperature through sensor DS18B20
## How to use our project
* First you will enter the timer setting mode for the first time of use
* There will be a mode switch button for each level I have clearly noted in the simulation
## What did we learn from the project?
* We have the datasheet of 8051,DS1307 and DS18B20
* We learned timer, how to use timer in buzzer
* Because we use C language to write code, we understand C better in microcontroller programming
